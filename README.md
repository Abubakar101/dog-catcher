## Assumptions

### MVP
- Put together the user stories and the wireframes to have a solid understanding and a bigger picture
- Break down the requirements into smaller tasks and then assigned them an estimate time-frame for each
- After having cleared approach in mind and while keeping the total time limit, I tried to tackled the time-consuming tasks first such as `typeahead` but within certain time-limit Or moved on to easier tasks if not met with a solution. 
- Refactored the code during the process to keep it simple and faster for the next tasks and prevented to type redundant & reusable code - to save time.


## Post-MVP
- Added CSS and some little tweaking to make it more friendly like button shadows.
- Removed commented out codes and comments. And organized and cleaned up.


8 hours total was fair amount of time and it was good enjoyable experience!
